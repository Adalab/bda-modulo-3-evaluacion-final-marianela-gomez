## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - `Customer_Flight_Activity.csv`: 

      - Duplicates: It seems like there are multiples rows that show the same data. Apparently, these data correspond to customers that even being partners of the loyalty program, they haven't use it in a period of time. There are also duplicated index (Loyalty Number), however this is normal since a customers might have data of different years. 

      - Nulls: The are no missing values. 
      
    - `Customer_Loyal_History.csv`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and patterns.
3. **Results & Interpretation**: Summarizing key insights.
4. **Conclusions & Next Steps**: Recommendations and future work.
